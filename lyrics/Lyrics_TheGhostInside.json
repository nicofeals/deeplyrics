  "plain": "The Ghost Inside is a melodic hardcore band formed in Los Angeles, California in 2004 under the name A Dying Dream. They released one EP and reformed in 2008 under the current name. They released Fury and the Fallen Ones in 2008 and Returners in 2010, both via Mediaskare Records.\n\nIn 2012, the band signed to Epitaph Records and released their breakthrough album Get What You Give, which spawned the single \u201cEngine 45\u201d. Two years later, they released Dear Youth.\n\nOn November 19, 2015 on highway 180 near border control checkpoint in El Paso, Texas, their tour bus struck a tractor trailer head-on, killing both drivers and leaving the band and crew with varying injuries. Vocalist Jonathan Vigil, guitarist Zach Johnson and drummer Andrew Tkaczyk, together with two crew members, were left in critical condition, while bassist Jim Riley, guitarist Chris Davis, and three other crew members had less serious injuries.\n\nSince the accident, all members of The Ghost Inside have undergone several surgeries and rehabilitation processes, including drummer Andrew Tkaczyk who lost his right leg, but have largely recuperated from the worst of the physical trauma they\u2019ve endured following the crash. On July 13, 2019, the band performed their first show in 4 years, but made it clear that they weren\u2019t sure when they\u2019d be ready to stand on the stage again. However, the band confirmed that they would be playing a few more shows come 2020, the first being in Germany at Full Force Festival.\n\nOn April 22, 2020, the band announced their first new song in over six years, titled \u201cAftermath.\u201d The song is the first of 11 songs to be featured on a self-titled full-length worked on together with Will Putney and Jeremy McKinnon, and due for release on June 5, 2020."

    "plain": "Front man Jonathan Vigil explains the concept behind the album in a letter that he wrote to his younger self:\n\nDear Youth,\n\nI\u2019m writing to you now because it seems I\u2019ve lost my way. I can\u2019t pinpoint exactly when it started, but I know that it\u2019s not like it was before. I\u2019ve realized the more time that passes, the more we lose touch. It\u2019s starting to feel like all I ever do now is lose touch with things. But not you, I never wanted to lose you.\n\nI wish I had something to blame it all on, but I don\u2019t. One day I was there and the next I was here. As if I was dreaming and suddenly woken up. These days I\u2019m always wondering if what I\u2019ve done is enough. It\u2019s getting harder and harder for me to shake this feeling of stagnance.\n\nSo old friend I\u2019m writing to ask you what it feels like to have the whole world in your hand? Where we could set out and do anything that we imagined. Endless possibilities way before complacence set in. To be honest with you, I\u2019ve forgotten what that all feels like. There was a wonder about us that has long since faded. That sense of excitement, I miss it.\n\nDear youth, will you show me again? I need to be reminded of those times, back before this began\u2026\n\n-xx (http://www.epitaph.com/artists/album/710/Dear_Youth#albdesc)"

I can\u2019t pinpoint exactly when it started, but I know that it\u2019s not like it was before. I\u2019ve realized the more time that passes, the more we lose touch. It\u2019s starting to feel like all I ever do now is lose touch with things. But not you, I never wanted to lose you.\n\nI wish I had something to blame it all on, but I don\u2019t. One day I was there and the next I was here. As if I was dreaming and suddenly woken up. These days I\u2019m always wondering if what I\u2019ve done is enough. It\u2019s getting harder and harder for me to shake this feeling of stagnance.\n\nSo old friend I\u2019m writing to ask you what it feels like to have the whole world in your hand? Where we could set out and do anything that we imagined. Endless possibilities way before complacence set in. To be honest with you, I\u2019ve forgotten what that all feels like. There was a wonder about us that has long since faded. That sense of excitement, I miss it.\n\nDear youth, will you show me again? I need to be reminded of those times, back before this began\u2026\n\n-xx (http://www.epitaph.com/artists/album/710/Dear_Youth#albdesc)"

Reset, rebuild!\nYou wrecked this city but not my will!"

       "plain": "Front man Jonathan Vigil explains the concept behind the album in a letter that he wrote to his younger self:\n\nDear Youth,\n\nI\u2019m writing to you now because it seems I\u2019ve lost my way. I can\u2019t pinpoint exactly when it started, but I know that it\u2019s not like it was before. I\u2019ve realized the more time that passes, the more we lose touch. It\u2019s starting to feel like all I ever do now is lose touch with things. But not you, I never wanted to lose you.\n\nI wish I had something to blame it all on, but I don\u2019t. One day I was there and the next I was here. As if I was dreaming and suddenly woken up. These days I\u2019m always wondering if what I\u2019ve done is enough. It\u2019s getting harder and harder for me to shake this feeling of stagnance.\n\nSo old friend I\u2019m writing to ask you what it feels like to have the whole world in your hand? Where we could set out and do anything that we imagined. Endless possibilities way before complacence set in. To be honest with you, I\u2019ve forgotten what that all feels like. There was a wonder about us that has long since faded. That sense of excitement, I miss it.\n\nDear youth, will you show me again? I need to be reminded of those times, back before this began\u2026\n\n-xx  (http://www.epitaph.com/artists/album/710/Dear_Youth#albdesc)"

I tried.)\nNow I live in regret never coming down to say goodbye\nOh why can't I?\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nThe man in black\nHe rides alone to a final destination unknown\nThe man in black\nHe rides alone; he's moving on\nI can't follow\n\n[Chorus x2]\nI used to be the fearless one\nLiving each day like death would never come\nNow I feel his cold breath on my neck\nHe's watching my steps and telling me that I could be next\n\n[Bridge]\nSo make way for the man in black\nMake way. He's never coming back\n\n[Outro/Breakdown]\nI am so lost at sea\nRyan, shine the light for me\nI'm sinking, I can't swim\nI need you here to pull me in\nI am so lost at sea\nRyan, shine your light for me\nI'm sinking, I can't swim\nI miss you brother\nYou will never dim"

I need to be reminded of those times, back before this began\u2026\n\n-xx (http://www.epitaph.com/artists/album/710/Dear_Youth#albdesc)"

   "lyrics": "True dedication most just do not possess\nWhen push becomes shove, can you rise above the rest?\nWaves of words, they fall short and crash at my feet\nSuch are the ways of the weak\n\nI'm not scared! It's all that I know\nDone nothing but travel without knowing where to go\nI've been digging up bones\nRemnants of what made up me I've never shown\n\nThis is my time to rise\nDark horse. I'll fight my way to the top\nYou will never be the thorn in my side\nDark horse. Dreams are my driving force\nOpen your eyes. Go live your own life\n\nI'm not scared! It's all that I know\nDone nothing but travel without knowing where to go\nI've been digging up bones\nRemnants of what made up me I've never shown\n\nWhen the smoke clears, and the damage is done\nI'll be the only one left standing\nI see someone without a shred of hope\nAt their breaking point. At the end of the rope\n\nI'm not scared! It's all that I know\nDone nothing but travel without knowing where to go\nI've been digging up bones\nRemnants of what made up me I'll never show\n\nI'm not scared! It's all that I know\nDone nothing but travel without knowing where to go\nI've been digging up bones\nRemnants of what made up me I'll never show"

I\u2019ve realized the more time that passes, the more we lose touch. It\u2019s starting to feel like all I ever do now is lose touch with things. But not you, I never wanted to lose you.\n\nI wish I had something to blame it all on, but I don\u2019t. One day I was there and the next I was here. As if I was dreaming and suddenly woken up. These days I\u2019m always wondering if what I\u2019ve done is enough. It\u2019s getting harder and harder for me to shake this feeling of stagnance.\n\nSo old friend I\u2019m writing to ask you what it feels like to have the whole world in your hand? Where we could set out and do anything that we imagined. Endless possibilities way before complacence set in. To be honest with you, I\u2019ve forgotten what that all feels like. There was a wonder about us that has long since faded. That sense of excitement, I miss it.\n\nDear youth, will you show me again?

Can you stand it?\nGave it all that I've got everywhere I roamed\nI can't do this alone, can you help me?\nThis is how it ends. We fall, we mend\nBurn and start again. Rebuild, forget\nLest we forget\nBreathe in, breathe out"

You remember A Dying Dream? Shit. Remember when they told us that we\u2019d never make anything that meant anything? Now we on each other\u2019s tracks, saying everything.\"\n\n[Verse 3: Jason Aalon Butler]\nI was always talking to myself because nobody would stick around\nDeveloped my own language and now I'm the loudest in the crowd\n(Now I have to) ask myself why they wanna stick around?\nIt's funny how they lift you up before they put you in the ground\nRemember those things we were all meant to fear\nAnd laugh as we realize they all got us here\nI am the one. Unfortunate sun\nMy death made a mark while your lives faded away\n\n[Chorus]\nI'll carry my weight where brave dare go\nThrough sleet, through rain, I'll trail courses unknown\nI'll carry my weight making sand out of stone\nI'll blaze this trail alone and take the long way home\n\n[Outro]\nI find strength where others find defeat. My eyes are open as I push on\nI used to always feel alone, but now I know I\u2019m not the only one"

I\u2019ve realized the more time that passes, the more we lose touch. It\u2019s starting to feel like all I ever do now is lose touch with things. But not you, I never wanted to lose you.\n\nI wish I had something to blame it all on, but I don\u2019t. One day I was there and the next I was here. As if I was dreaming and suddenly woken up. These days I\u2019m always wondering if what I\u2019ve done is enough. It\u2019s getting harder and harder for me to shake this feeling of stagnance.\n\nSo old friend I\u2019m writing to ask you what it feels like to have the whole world in your hand? Where we could set out and do anything that we imagined. Endless possibilities way before complacence set in. To be honest with you, I\u2019ve forgotten what that all feels like. There was a wonder about us that has long since faded. That sense of excitement, I miss it.\n\nDear youth, will you show me again? I need to be reminded of those times, back before this began\u2026\n\n-xx (http://www.epitaph.com/artists/album/710/Dear_Youth#albdesc)"

It's the end to all my means\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nConstantly incomplete\n\n[Chorus]\nWith my back against the wall, I stack brick by brick by brick by brick\nI will rise above them all like this like this like this like this\nWith my back against the wall, I stack brick by brick by brick by brick\nI will rise above them all like this like this\n\n[Verse 2]\nI may not be forgiven, but I forgave and I'll forget\nGoing through the motions is no way to exist\nSo if there's anybody out there that's so sick of feeling alone\nHas the damage already been done? You gotta get from underneath that gun\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nWe walk before we run\n\n[Chorus]\nWith my back against the wall, I stack brick by brick by brick by brick\nI will rise above them all like this like this like this like this\nWith my back against the wall, I stack brick by brick by brick by brick\nI will rise above them all like this like this\n\n[Bridge]\nMove me, choose me\nPlease before you lose me!\nFind me, drive me\nEnd the things that pride me!\nMove me, improve me\nIgnite the flame that ruled me!\nGuide me, collide me\nI need something to survive me!\n\n[Outro/Chorus]\nWith my back against the wall. I will rise above them all like this\nComing back against all odds, I stack brick by brick by brick by brick\nI will rise above them all like this like this like this like this\nWith my back against the wall, I stack brick by brick by brick by brick\nI will rise above them all like this like this!"

I am not afraid\nYou're not getting older; you're just getting old\nAnd your finish wears thin as your stories get told\nYet you've somehow impressed her; she's already sold\nThe one page in your book that's still shining in gold says\n\"Wishing for the years to flash by\nHas left me blind\nI'm waiting for the few fleeting moments\nWhere the world makes sense to me.\"\nI want to take the time to stop and think\nAbout doing this, and what it might mean to be\nWhen I close my eyes, there's nothing but darkness revealed\nIt's right there in front of me\nLooking forward for a taste of things to come\nI can't see familiar faces on anyone\nLife is trying to pass me by\nBut not this time. I am not afraid\nI am not afraid\nMy search continues for a taste of things to come\nI can't see familiar faces on anyone\nLife is trying its best to pass by\nBut not this time. I am not afraid\n(I am not afraid.)"

    "plain": "Drummer Andrew Tkaczyk shared the following with Blunt Magazine:\n\n\u201cThat song started off, just Vigil had come to my house. He came out to stay with me just to hang and be nerds and play video games in October of 2018. While he was here I knew I wanted to try and do some writing because I had my own studio here at home and I wanted to track Vigil and get him to do some vocals at my place.\n\nHe was taking a shower at my house and I was in my studio writing and he said I was playing guitar so loud he could hear it through the wall, he heard a rhythm. He just thought of it in the shower because he heard it through the walls.\n\nThere\u2019s parts of the song that sound like more of a throwback version of The Ghost Inside. Then there\u2019s that whole clean, melodic break and it\u2019s just, it\u2019s got that snare roll over all the pretty leads and the really big positive ending.\n\nI even got a Ghost Inside sleeve tattoo recently that had a phoenix on it at the top coming out of an urn. An urn that had the TGI logo on it. The phoenix is super symbolic to us and this our homage to that on that song on this record.\""

He came out to stay with me just to hang and be nerds and play video games in October of 2018. While he was here I knew I wanted to try and do some writing because I had my own studio here at home and I wanted to track Vigil and get him to do some vocals at my place.\n\nHe was taking a shower at my house and I was in my studio writing and he said I was playing guitar so loud he could hear it through the wall, he heard a rhythm. He just thought of it in the shower because he heard it through the walls.\n\nThere\u2019s parts of the song that sound like more of a throwback version of The Ghost Inside. Then there\u2019s that whole clean, melodic break and it\u2019s just, it\u2019s got that snare roll over all the pretty leads and the really big positive ending.\n\nI even got a Ghost Inside sleeve tattoo recently that had a phoenix on it at the top coming out of an urn. An urn that had the TGI logo on it. The phoenix is super symbolic to us and this our homage to that on that song on this record.\""

But I'll survive\nFace forward into the night\n\n[Chorus]\nThrown into the fire\nLike the phoenix reborn, I rise\nThe new dawn burns brighter\nSo face forward into the night\n\n[Pre-Breakdown]\nI've put up all these walls, no further I could fall\nCan I destroy the doubt and still come out on top of it all?\nNo more \"what could have been\"\nWin the war within\n\n[Breakdown]\nOvercome the setback and leave this hollow shell in the past\nIt's not much, but it's enough\nIt's a spark, it's a start once again\nIt's not much, but it's enough\nTo win the war within\n\n[Bridge]\n(I have to let this go, I have to let this end)\n(I need to shed my skin, shed my skin and begin again)\nI'm more than my mistakes\nWhat more can one man take and still survive?\nFace forward into the night\n(I have to let this go, I have to let this end)\nI'm more than my mistakes\nWhat more can one man take? But I'll survive\nFace forward into the night\n(I need to shed my skin, shed my skin and begin again)\nI'm more than my mistakes\nWhat more can one man take and still survive?\nFace forward into the night\nI'm more than my mistakes\nWhat more can one man take? But I'll survive\nFace forward into the night\n\n[Outro]\nThrown into the fire\nLike the phoenix reborn, I rise\nThe new dawn burns brighter\nSo face forward into the night\nThrown into the fire\nLike the phoenix reborn, I rise\nThe new dawn burns brighter\nSo face forward into the night\nThrown into the fire\nLike the phoenix reborn, I rise\nThe new dawn burns brighter\nSo face forward into the night\nThrown into the fire\nLike the phoenix reborn, I rise\nThe new dawn burns brighter\nSo face forward into the night"

    "plain": "Dear Youth,\n\nI\u2019m writing to you now because it seems I\u2019ve lost my way. I can\u2019t pinpoint exactly when it started, but I know that it\u2019s not like it was before. I\u2019ve realized the more time that passes, the more we lose touch. It\u2019s starting to feel like all I ever do now is lose touch with things. But not you, I never wanted to lose you.\n\nI wish I had something to blame it all on, but I don\u2019t. One day I was there and the next I was here. As if I was dreaming and suddenly woken up. These days I\u2019m always wondering if what I\u2019ve done is enough. It\u2019s getting harder and harder for me to shake this feeling of stagnance.\n\nSo old friend I\u2019m writing to ask you what it feels like to have the whole world in your hand? Where we could set out and do anything that we imagined. Endless possibilities way before complacence set in. To be honest with you, I\u2019ve forgotten what that all feels like. There was a wonder about us that has long since faded. That sense of excitement, I miss it.\n\nDear youth, will you show me again? I need to be reminded of those times, back before this began\u2026\n\n-xx (http://www.epitaph.com/artists/album/710/Dear_Youth#albdesc)"

       "plain": "Dear Youth,\n\nI\u2019m writing to you now because it seems I\u2019ve lost my way. I can\u2019t pinpoint exactly when it started, but I know that it\u2019s not like it was before. I\u2019ve realized the more time that passes, the more we lose touch. It\u2019s starting to feel like all I ever do now is lose touch with things. But not you, I never wanted to lose you.\n\nI wish I had something to blame it all on, but I don\u2019t. One day I was there and the next I was here. As if I was dreaming and suddenly woken up. These days I\u2019m always wondering if what I\u2019ve done is enough. It\u2019s getting harder and harder for me to shake this feeling of stagnance.\n\nSo old friend I\u2019m writing to ask you what it feels like to have the whole world in your hand? Where we could set out and do anything that we imagined. Endless possibilities way before complacence set in. To be honest with you, I\u2019ve forgotten what that all feels like. There was a wonder about us that has long since faded. That sense of excitement, I miss it.\n\nDear youth, will you show me again? I need to be reminded of those times, back before this began\u2026\n\n-xx (http://www.epitaph.com/artists/album/710/Dear_Youth#albdesc)"
